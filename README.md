Passionate about technology and always looking to learn, I entered the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in 2016, encouraged by curiosity and the desire to be part of this field capable of impacting everyone in all ways.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS, React Native and NodeJS
- ⚡ Fun fact: Drinking too much coffee makes me have headaches!
- 💬 Ask me what you want, let's talk, share experiences
- 😄 Pronouns: MB, Estela
